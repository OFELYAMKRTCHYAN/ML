## House Price Prediction with Linear Regression and Regularization

In this project, we used the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices using machine learning. We cleaned the data, handled missing values and outliers. We trained a Linear Regression model and applied regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to reduce overfitting and compare model performance. The project was implemented using Python and scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
